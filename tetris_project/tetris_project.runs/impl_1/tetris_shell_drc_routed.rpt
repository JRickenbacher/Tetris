2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net game_controller/MAKE_MOVE_EN is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin game_controller/count_make_move_en_reg_i_1/O, cell game_controller/count_make_move_en_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net game_controller/READ_COLLISION is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin game_controller/count_valid_move_en_reg_i_1/O, cell game_controller/count_valid_move_en_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net game_controller/count_write_new_piece_en_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin game_controller/count_write_new_piece_en_reg_i_1/O, cell game_controller/count_write_new_piece_en_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net piece_memory_block/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin piece_memory_block/top_left_addr_col_reg[4]_i_2/O, cell piece_memory_block/top_left_addr_col_reg[4]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net piece_memory_block/curr_action_reg[0]_1[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin piece_memory_block/next_addr_3_col_reg[4]_i_2/O, cell piece_memory_block/next_addr_3_col_reg[4]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
